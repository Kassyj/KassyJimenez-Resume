        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a college student who is majoring in psychology. I have had past jobs that are more of just volunteer work. I’ve never had a paying job. All the jobs listed on my resume are volunteer work. They have taught me to be humble and that it is important to work hard. I was born in Orange County and raised near Los Angeles. I saw how hard my parents worked for money and to keep the lights on. This started my passion for work. My parents gave me the drive to work hard and to be determined. I saw that in life to get ahead I knew I had to get an education. To be able to get enough money to survive I had to have a drive for it, so I did. I grew my grit and my drive for work and for my education. I worked hard on my education. I studied hard to get good grades. I faced a big challenge in my education when I had to move 2 hours away from my home. <br><br>

        Everything was new to me. I had no idea where I would go for school or anyone there. I was put into a school last minute, a week before school started. I had no choice in my classes or any counselor to show me around. The first day comes and I am immediately lost. I made a new friend to try to have someone. I got accepted into a higher level school a week into the school year so again I had to move. I settled down well in my new school and actually had good grades again. I had new friends and around high school years I knew where I was and I had classes I liked. During my senior year of high school I did a lot of volunteering. It was a requirement for my senior transition class. At first I saw it as another chore or homework assignment. I volunteered at my local church and at my school. Volunteering at my local church really helped me get out and meet new friends. I learned a lot about the kitchen and the church community. I saw the community come together and help each other out.<br><br>

         Seeing how everyone was there and being able to help feed multiple people. It was a heartwarming experience to help the poor and to help with people who are just struggling to make food. My next volunteer experience was at my school. I helped a lot of parents and children see the school and help them get prepared for the school year. I helped girls get measured for their skirts and I helped parents help their children. I gave small tours of the school to parents and students so they would be ready when the school year began. Everyone was so extremely thankful for the help and advice I gave them. Seeing all the smiling faces on all the people I helped really helped me and made my days. Knowing I helped so many people was an extremely warming gift.
